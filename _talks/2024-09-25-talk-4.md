Talk Abstract: Several open problems have been asked and are being solved on the nature of dagger structures that can be defined on Fusion Categories. Using previous work that has been done investigating the Hermitian Dagger case, we now shift our focus to dealing with Fusion Categories that have a Non-Hermitian Dagger structure on them. What can we do with these categories? Do they yield any interesting properties? We discuss the outline of proofs of theorems on the MÃ¼ger center, braiding, and spherical structure of such a fusion category, and discuss a potential construction of a TQFT, and what it could mean for us.
