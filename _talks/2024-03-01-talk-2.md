Based on So Okada's ["Quintic periods and stability conditions via homological mirror symmetry"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0937). Part of my final presentation for [Ma148b (Topics in Mathematical Physics)](https://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/Ma148Winter2024.html). [notes](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sbgxmwfskmqj#0e68e7)

Remark: Please ignore where I write "not needed" in my notes â€” that was a personal note for me to not say that stuff out loud.
