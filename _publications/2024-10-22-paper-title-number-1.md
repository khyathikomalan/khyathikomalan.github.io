excerpt: 'In this paper, we provide a construction of a Topological Quantum Field Theory
from a Non-Hermitian Ribbon Fusion Category. This is a simple method that does not involve
enriching over Fusion Categories, or using other complicated structures. To substantiate this
construction, we also prove theorems on the Müger center, braiding, and spherical structure of
such a fusion category. [Submitted for Publication]'
