collection: work

permalink: /publication/2024-10-22-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we provide a construction of a Topological Quantum Field Theory
from a Non-Hermitian Ribbon Fusion Category. This is a simple method that does not involve
enriching over Fusion Categories, or using other complicated structures. To substantiate this
construction, we also prove theorems on the MÃ¼ger center, braiding, and spherical structure of
such a fusion category. [Submitted for Publication]'
