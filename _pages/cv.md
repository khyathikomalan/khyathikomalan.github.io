Education
======

* B.S. in Mathematics, California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Class of 2027 (on leave since Spring 2024)

Selected Projects
======
* January 2025 - Ongoing: Structuring Quantum Effects Using Monads and Arrows, Adjoint School 2025
  * Selected to participate in the Adjoint School 2025, a graduate-level research program of 16 weeks on Applied Category Theory. One of sixteen students accepted, and one of four students selected to work on the project "Structuring Quantum Effects with Monads and Arrows" under Juliana Kaizer Vizzotto. This program will culminate in a blog post on n-Category Cafe, and participation + presentation at the Applied Category Theory conference to be held at the University of Florida.
  * Currently working on recreating and debugging the Haskell code from two papers that use arrows in order to model quantum effects. The goal of our project is to see if we can use relative monads to model superoperators.

* May 2024: Constructing TQFTs Using Non-Hermitian Ribbon Fusion Categories
  * In this paper, we provide a construction of a Topological Quantum Field Theory from a Non-Hermitian Ribbon Fusion Category. This is a simple method that does not involve enriching over Fusion Categories, or using other complicated structures. To substantiate this construction, we also prove theorems on the MÃ¼ger center, braiding, and spherical structure of such a fusion category
  * Currently working on computing S and T matrices of these categories, and associating Hopf Algebras

* December 2024 - Ongoing: Categorifying Wild Fusion Categories
  * Investigating ways to study Wild Knot Theory using Fusion Categories
  
Selected Awards and Honors
======
* Emergent Ventures India Grantee: Awarded a grant for career development, giving me financial support to further my interest in category theory.
* Awarded the 2024 Morgan Ward Prize for my paper "Constructing TQFTs Using Non-Hermitian Ribbon Fusion Categories". This prize is awarded to Caltech freshmen or sophomores for providing a solution or significant contribution toward a solution for a problem. The entry is judged on the basis of the nature of the problem, originality, and elegance of the solution.
* Awarded the 2022 Spirit of Ramanujan Fellowship, which I used to fund my participation in the Ross Mathematics Program.
* Cleared the Qualifier Round of the Scholastic Test for Excellence in Mathematics (STEMS) hosted by CMI in 2022.
