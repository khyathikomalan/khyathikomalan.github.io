i'm a rising sophomore at caltech, where i study on a full scholarship made possible by the generosity of an [emergent ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) benefactor. i was also a participant in the 2025 [adjoint school](https://adjointschool.com/2025.html). 

i've been fascinated by the idea of applying category theory to understand the world better, from quantum physics to social relationships. i'm a strong believer in making abstract mathematical ideas accessible to all, especially people from a humanities background. to this end, my mathematical thinking has been greatly influenced by [eugenia cheng](https://eugeniacheng.com/) and [john baez](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/). apart from my interest in math and physics, i enjoy thinking about different cultures, visual media, music, contemporary philosophy, true crime, drug legalization, and so much more â€” some of my thoughts can be found at my [blog](https://khyathikomalan.github.io/year-archive/). i'm currently working on a screenplay about invisibility. 

mathematically, i currently enjoy thinking about: fusion categories, TQFTs, wild knots (and knot theory in general), catcolab, persistent homology, homotopy type theory, categorical systems theory. here's a fairly accessible talk on what i've been thinking about lately (double categorical AQFTs): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kMZ8P0hNJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kMZ8P0hNJo). 

when it comes to travel and exploration, i love big cities. my favourite part of exploring a new area is trying out new restaurants. i'm on the [beli app](https://beliapp.co/app/khyathik). i'm a huge fan of los angeles, i'm not a great photographer by any means, but i've collected some of my favourite [photos](https://khyathikomalan.github.io/portfolio/).
